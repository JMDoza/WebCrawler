## About the uploaded files (Web Scraper in process)

In this project files, when user clicks download button, it grabs images urls, and replaces them to base64, and sends base64 to a new page 

At the same time, it saves the webpage that you want (only text and css)

Next step, try to insert the base64 to the webpage we want to scrape
